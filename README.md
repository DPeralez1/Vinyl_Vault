#### Description:

Vinyl Vault is a web-based application designed to help users manage their vinyl record collections. The app allows users to add records to their collection, view the entire collection in a sortable table, and delete records as needed.

Im very proud of this project even if the scale isnt where I want it to be. I learned so much with SQlite and Python and being able to integrate them to a web applicaiton. I know there is more that can be added to this project and other features that would make it better. I plan to add them eventually but I didnt want to try and add too much and never find a good enough spot to turn this in.

### Key Features:

- **Add Records**: Users can input the artist and album name to add a new record to the collection.
- **View Collection**: All records are displayed in a sortable and responsive table, organized alphabetically by artist.
- **Delete Records**: Users can easily remove records from their collection with a single click.

### Technologies Used:

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja
- **Database**: SQLite

Detailed breakdown of the stack:

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **SQLite**: A self-contained, serverless SQL database engine used for the project's database.
- **FontAwesome**: Provides a set of icons to enhance the visual appeal of the application.
